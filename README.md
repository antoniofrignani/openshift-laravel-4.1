###How to use this repo
Just create a new ZendServer 5.6 or PHP 5.3 gear from your OpenShift control panel and while creating, supply this git repository's checkout URL (https://github.com/antoniofrignani/openshift-laravel-4.1) in the "Source Code" field. That's it. And oh by the way, don't forget to add a MySQL cartridge later in this gear.
